This is the start of my HW2 project in R.  I am excited to learn more about the language.
I think this homework assignment will be useful in my Masters' capstone class where we have to wrangle some data.
I have finihsed Step 4 problem 1 so I am updating my file on github.
I have now completed the plotting section of the homework.
